# Clan Explanation

Each Season the clan system in Destiny 2 allows our clan to level up via an XP system. Each character has a individual cap of 5,000 XP and the clan has a weekly cap for all characters. As of Season 4 XP is gained by visiting Hawthorne in the Tower/Farm and collecting Clan XP bounties. Turning these bounties in will reward you with Clan XP.

Sometimes people decide to stop playing the game for a while, and that’s fine. However, if you are inactive for at least a one month period, the clan is full, and new people who are more active would like to join the clan, we reserve the right to remove you. Also we expect all clan members to turn in at least one clan XP bounty per season to be considered active, even if they log in every day.

If we do end up removing you for inactivity this does not mean that you are unwelcome to return. You may reapply again once you’re back on the grind. This is simply an effort to keep as many active people in the clan as possible, so that we can all enjoy doing activities together.
