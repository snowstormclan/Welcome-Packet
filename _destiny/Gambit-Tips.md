Not covered in the above graphic

- There is a catch-up mechanic. The team that summons the Primeval second, gets a boost to the buff “Primeval Slayer”. This buff will always be less than the team who did the first summon and the amount of stacks you get depend on how many the other team has and how much damage they have done to their Primeval. Further reading can be found *[HERE](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/248864293)* as it provides clarification on how the mechanic works.
- The score bar will turn into a health gauge after the Primeval is spawned for that specific team. This lets you know how fast they are killing it in the case you’re in a race.
- It’s good to play from a distance to see the number of motes your allies have. If you’re running in and gobbling them up like Pac-Man and your ally is as well, neither of you can see how many motes the other person has. This is something to be mindful of, it’s easy to say “let the person with 9 motes get one more” but if you’re right next to them, you can’t easily see that.
- With the above, if you are playing from farther away you will still want to be ready to swoop in and grab flashing motes. If they are flashing it means they are going to vanish soon. A pile of 10 motes all flashing that goes away makes The Drifter sad, and you don’t want that do you?
- The mini map will show you where motes are. Above you will have a ^ on the mote icon and below you will have a v on the icon. The mini map does not show if a mote is flashing, you will still need to use your eyes for that.
- Going for a “*[Fast 5](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596343/?ref_=nv_sr_1)*” has become a term a lot of us use to say “I’m going to bank my first five motes to throw a blocker up for the enemy”. This can be an effective strategy especially if two Guardians do it around the same time. After the first one though, solo banking 5 has little to no effect. As well as banking 15 solo is almost never worth it, ogres can be melted very fast with an IKELOS shotgun (trench barrel shines here). If you’re waiting for a full 15 to bank, you’re just going to draw an invader to you and can lose them for your team; you can be effective bait too but that requires a lot of communication and experience with your team.
- When the invader spawns you will want to turn and kill them. They will have a harder time killing you if 4 Guardians and shooting at them. If you run and hide in the base, especially with 0 motes, you’re only making it easier for the invader. Stand and fight, Guardian; it’s what Shaxx would do.
