# How to Use Charlemagne LFG

Charlemagne is a powerful tool for putting together groups on a whim, and doesnâ€™t require an additional sign-up on a separate website like the100. You can create listings directly in Discord.

Some Commands:

To create an event: `!lfg create`

To edit your created event: `!lfg edit (listing number)`

To join an event without going to the clan-lfg chat: `!lfg join (listing number)`

To delete your LFG: `!lfg delete (listing number)`

A typical LFG listing looks like:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/image1-0a4421da-2f54-4355-932f-b9ff98f937f5.png)

1. The activity, and the goals/requirements as decided by the creator
2. The start time and date
3. The join ID that you can type in !lfg join (listing ID)
4. The time and date again, though this one will tell you the more accurate time if you are not in PST (Central or Eastern, for example)
    - `+` Join the listing
    - `-` Leave the listing
    - `?` Sign up as an alt, which fills a spot should someone be unable to make the event

# Creating your own LFG events in 3 easy steps

1. Use **`!lfg create`** in the `#lfg-clan channel`, let the system load the questions.
2. Click the Discord **reaction**  to the corresponding option you want.

    1. If the option you want isn't listed use the arrows to paginate.
    2. You may have to wait for Charlemagne to add all the reactions first before it will respond to input.
3. Some questions are open text input so you just need to review what you're being asked and type into the same channel your response.

If you make a mistake when creating your event you can edit via **`!lfg edit (listing number)`** or you can delete the event and start over **`!lfg delete (listing number)`**
