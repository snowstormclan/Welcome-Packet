# Blind Well & Escalation Protocol Trick

Switching to EU is a match-making work-around, for such activities as Escalation Protocol and Blind Well. Battlenet match-makes based on region, and Destiny 2 match-makes based on ping. By switching to EU, we therefore have terrible ping with everyone in Europe, but fantastic ping for everyone in the US. This helps us get three separate party members into the same instance quickly so we can have a full nine-person squad of clan members.
